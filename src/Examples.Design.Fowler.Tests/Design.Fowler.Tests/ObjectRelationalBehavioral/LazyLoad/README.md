## Lazy Initialization

Lazy Initialization is the most direct way to implement **lazy loading within the object itself**.

Inside the getter method for a field (e.g., `getOrders()` in a Customer object), it checks if that field has been initialized (i.e., if it is `null`). If it is `null`, it queries the database at that moment to retrieve the data, sets it to the field, and then returns the value. On subsequent calls, the data is already present in the field, so no database query is made.

- Pros
  - The implementation is simple and intuitive.
  - Easy to introduce as it doesn't require a special framework.
- Cons
  - The object itself contains the data-fetching logic (e.g., SQL queries), which creates a strong dependency between the object and the data source (database). This can harm code reusability and testability.
  - Similar `null`-checking logic must be written for every field that requires lazy loading.

### 11.3.3 Lazy Initialization

> On first access of the product field, the data is read from the database

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor client
    participant Supplier as sup:Supplier
    participant Product
    participant database

    client ->> Supplier : getProduct()
    activate Supplier
    Supplier ->> Supplier : [products == null]
    activate Supplier
    Supplier ->> Product : Product.findForSupplier(getID())
    activate Product
    Product ->> database : "SELECT ... WHERE supplier_id = sup.id"
    Product -->> Supplier : products
    deactivate Product
    deactivate Supplier
    Supplier -->> client : List
    deactivate Supplier
```

## Virtual Proxy

Virtual Proxy is an approach that **uses a stand-in" (a proxy) for the real object**.

From the client's perspective, the proxy object looks exactly like the real object (it has the same interface and methods). However, this proxy does not initially contain the real data.
When a client calls any of the proxy's methods for the first time, the proxy secretly loads the real object from the database and delegates the method call to it.

- Pros
  - It separates the lazy-loading logic from the domain object into the proxy. This keeps the domain object's responsibilities clean.
  - The client doesn't need to know whether it's interacting with the real object or the proxy.
- Cons
  - It can lead to "identity" issues. The proxy object and the real object loaded later are two different instances in memory. This can cause unexpected results when comparing objects for identity (e.g., with `==`).
  - It may require a framework or library to dynamically generate proxies.

### 11.3.4 Virtual Proxy

> The most complicated thing about creating a list proxy is that it must be configured to provide an underlying list that is only created when accessed, by passing the code necessary to create the list to the virtual list when it is instantiated.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  namespace Domains {
    class SupplierVL {
      +setProducts(VirtualList)
      +getProduct() List
    }
    class VirtualList {
      -source List
      +VirtualList(VirtualListLoader)
      +getSource() List
    }
    class VirtualListLoader {
      <<Interface>>
      +load() : List
    }
  }
  namespace DataSources {
    class SupplierMapper {
        #doLoad(Long, ResultSet)
    }
    class ProductLoader {
      +load() : List
    }
    class ProductMapper {
      +findForSupplier(Long)
    }
  }

  SupplierVL o--> VirtualList
  VirtualListLoader <|.. ProductLoader
  VirtualList o--> VirtualListLoader : loader
  SupplierMapper ..> SupplierVL : new
  SupplierMapper ..> VirtualList : new
  SupplierMapper ..> ProductLoader : new
  ProductLoader ..> ProductMapper : create()
```

> The source list itself is encapsulated in the virtual list, and the loader is evaluated on first reference.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor client
    participant SupplierVL as sup:SupplierVL

    client ->> SupplierVL : getProduct()
    activate SupplierVL
    SupplierVL ->> VirtualList : getSource()
    activate VirtualList
    VirtualList ->> VirtualList : [source == null]
    activate VirtualList
    VirtualList ->> ProductLoader : VirtualListLoader.load()
    activate ProductLoader
    ProductLoader ->> ProductMapper : create()
    activate ProductMapper
    ProductLoader ->> ProductMapper : findForSupplier(Long)
    ProductMapper ->> database : "SELECT ...  WHERE supplier_id = sup.id"
    ProductMapper -->> ProductLoader : List
    deactivate ProductMapper
    ProductLoader -->> VirtualList : List
    deactivate ProductLoader
    deactivate VirtualList
    VirtualList -->> SupplierVL : List
    deactivate VirtualList
    SupplierVL ->> client : List
    deactivate SupplierVL
```

## Value Holder

A Value Holder is a technique that **uses a generic object to encapsulate the data-loading logic**.

Instead of holding the actual data (e.g., a list of `Order` objects), a field in an object holds a Value Holder object. This Value Holder knows how to fetch the data.
When the actual data is needed, the object asks the Value Holder to `getValue()`. On the first request, the Value Holder queries the database, loads the data, stores it internally, and returns it.

- Pros
  - The data-loading logic is completely separated into a reusable Value Holder class. This frees the domain object from being aware of the data source.
  - It is very flexible and the same mechanism can be applied to many different objects.
- Cons
  - The code becomes slightly more indirect, as the client must get the value through the Value Holder instead of directly from the field.

### 11.3.5 Use Value Holder

> The value holders themselves behave like reggie loads.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor client
    participant SupplierVH as sup:SupplierVH
    participant ValueHolder

    client ->> SupplierVH : getProduct()
    activate SupplierVH
    SupplierVH ->> ValueHolder : getValue()
    activate ValueHolder
    ValueHolder ->> ValueHolder : [value == null]
    activate ValueHolder
    ValueHolder ->> ProductLoader : ValueLoader.load()
    activate ProductLoader
    ProductLoader ->> ProductMapper : create()
    activate ProductMapper
    ProductLoader ->> ProductMapper : findForSupplier(Long)
    ProductMapper ->> database : "SELECT ...  WHERE supplier_id = sup.id"
    ProductMapper -->>  ProductLoader : List
    deactivate ProductMapper
    ProductLoader -->> ValueHolder : List
    deactivate ProductLoader
    deactivate ValueHolder
    ValueHolder -->> SupplierVH : List
    deactivate ValueHolder
    SupplierVH -->> client : List
```

## Ghost object

A Ghost is an approach where **an object is first created in a "hollow" state, containing only its ID**.

When an object is loaded from the database, it is first instantiated in a partial (incomplete) state with only its ID populated. This is the "Ghost." At this point, memory consumption is minimal.
Later, when the application accesses any field other than the ID (e.g., name, date) for the first time, that access triggers a full load from the database. The object then populates all of its own fields, turning into a "real," fully-loaded object.

- Pros
  - Since the object instance exists from the beginning, it avoids the identity issues seen with Virtual Proxy.
  - It allows you to set up associations between objects using their ghost references before they are fully loaded.
- Cons
  - The implementation can be complex, as it requires a mechanism to track the state of the object (ghost or fully loaded).
  - The object itself needs to contain the logic for loading its full state from the database based on its current state.

### 11.3.6 Use Ghost

> For loading to work, the domain object needs to call the appropriate mapper, but in my experience, the domain code may not know about the mapper object. To avoid dependencies on specific objects, I use a combination of a registry and separate interfaces.

Classes involved in Ghost loading:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  namespace Domains {
    class DomainObject {
       <<Abstract>> 
      #Load()
    }

    class Employee {
    }

    class DataSource {
      +Load(DomainObject)$
      +Init(IDataSource)$
    }

    class IDataSource {
       <<Interface>>
      +Load(DomainObject)
    }

  }
  namespace DataSources {
    class Mapper {
       <<Abstract>>
      +AbstractFind(long) DomainObject
      +Load(DomainObject)
      #CreateGhost(long) DomainObject
      +LoadLine(IDataReader, DomainObject)
      #DoLoadLine(IDataReader, DomainObject)
    }

    class EmployeeMapper {
      +Find(long)
    }

    class MapperRegistry {
      +Mapper(Type) Mapper
    }
  }

  DomainObject <|-- Employee
  DomainObject ..> DataSource
  DataSource ..> IDataSource
  Mapper <|-- EmployeeMapper
  Employee <.. EmployeeMapper
  IDataSource <|.. MapperRegistry
  Mapper <--o MapperRegistry : class
```

Ghost Loading Sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor client
    participant Employee as emp:Employee
    participant DataSource
    participant MapperRegistry
    participant EmployeeMapper
    participant database

    client->>Employee : Name 
    activate Employee
    Employee ->> Employee : Load()
    activate Employee
    Employee ->> DataSource : [IsGhost]Load(emp)
    activate DataSource
    DataSource ->> MapperRegistry: IDataSource.Load(emp)
    activate MapperRegistry
    MapperRegistry ->> MapperRegistry : Mapper(emp.GetType)
    activate MapperRegistry
    deactivate MapperRegistry
    MapperRegistry ->> EmployeeMapper : Load(emp)
    activate EmployeeMapper
    EmployeeMapper ->> database : "SELECT ... WHERE id = emp.Key"
    EmployeeMapper -->> Employee : --load various properties
    activate Employee
    deactivate EmployeeMapper
    deactivate MapperRegistry
    deactivate DataSource
    deactivate Employee
    deactivate Employee
    deactivate Employee
```

> Collections are the most complex case: to avoid reloading, it is important to load all TimeRecords in one query, which requires a special list implementation that acts as a ghost list.

Ghost List Classes:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class IList~T~{
    <<Interface>>
  }

  namespace Domains{
    class DomainList~T~{
      -data IList~T~
    }
    class Loader{
      <<delegate>>
      +Loader(DomainList~T~)
    }
  }

  namespace DataSources {
    class Mapper{
    }
    class ListLoader{
      +Sql : string
      +SqlParams: IDictionary~string,object~
      +Load(DomainList~T~)
      +Attach(DomainList~T~)
    }
  }

  IList~T~ <|.. DomainList~T~

  DomainList~T~ *--> "1" Loader : RunLoader

  Loader .. ListLoader : ListLoader.Load(list)
  ListLoader --> "1" Mapper
```
