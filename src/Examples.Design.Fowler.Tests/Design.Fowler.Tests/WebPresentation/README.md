## Model View Controller

Splits user interface interaction into three distinct roles.

## Page Controller

An object that handles a request for a specific page or action on a Web site.

## Front Controller

A controller that handles all requests for a Web site.

## Template View

Renders information into HTML by embedding markers in an HTML page.

## Transform View

A view that processes domain data element by element and transforms it into HTML.

## Two Step View

Turns domain data into HTML in two steps: first by forming some kind of logical page, then rendering the logical page into HTML.

## Application Controller

A centralized point for handling screen navigation and the flow of an application.
