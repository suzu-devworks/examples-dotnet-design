## Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

- [Catalog of Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/)

### Domain Logic Patterns

- ***Transaction Script***
  Organizes business logic by procedures where each procedure handles a single request from the presentation.

- ***Domain Model***
  An object model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data.

- ***Table Module***
  A single instance that handles the business logic for all rows in a database table or view.

- ***Service Layer***
  Defines an application's boundary with a layer of services that establishes a set of available operations and coordinates the application's response in each operation.

### Data Source Architectural Patterns

- ***Identity Field***
  Saves a database ID field in an object to maintain identity between an in-memory object and a database row.

- ***Inheritance Mappers***
  A structure to organize database mappers that handle inheritance hierarchies.

- ***Foreign Key Mapping***
  Maps an association between objects to a foreign key reference between tables.

- ***Association Table Mapping***
  Saves an association as a table with foreign keys to the tables that are linked by the association.

- ***Dependent Mapping***
  Has one class perform the database mapping for a child class.

- ***Embedded Value***
  Maps an object into several fields of another object's table.

- ***Serialized LOB***
  Saves a graph of objects by serializing them into a single large object (LOB), which it stores in a database field.

- ***Single Table Inheritance***
  Represents an inheritance hierarchy of classes as a single table that has columns for all the fields of the various classes.

- ***Class Table Inheritance***
  Represents an inheritance hierarchy of classes with one table for each class.

- ***Concrete Table Inheritance***
  Represents an inheritance hierarchy of classes with one table per concrete class in the hierarchy.

### Object-Relational Behavioral Patterns

- ***Unit of Work***
  Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes and the resolution of concurrency problems.

- ***Identity Map***
  Ensures that each object gets loaded only once by keeping every loaded object in a map. Looks up objects using the map when referring to them.

- [***Lazy Load***](./Designs.Fowler.Tests/ObjectRelationalBehavioral/LazyLoad/README.md)
  An object that doesn't contain all of the data you need but knows how to get it.

### Object-Relational Structural Patterns

- ***Identity Field***
  Saves a database ID field in an object to maintain identity between an in-memory object and a database row.

- ***Inheritance Mappers***
  A structure to organize database mappers that handle inheritance hierarchies.

- ***Foreign Key Mapping***
  Maps an association between objects to a foreign key reference between tables.

- ***Association Table Mapping***
  Saves an association as a table with foreign keys to the tables that are linked by the association.

- ***Dependent Mapping***
  Has one class perform the database mapping for a child class.

- ***Embedded Value***
  Maps an object into several fields of another object's table.

- ***Serialized LOB***
  Saves a graph of objects by serializing them into a single large object (LOB), which it stores in a database field.

- ***Single Table Inheritance***
  Represents an inheritance hierarchy of classes as a single table that has columns for all the fields of the various classes.

- ***Class Table Inheritance***
  Represents an inheritance hierarchy of classes with one table for each class.

- ***Concrete Table Inheritance***
  Represents an inheritance hierarchy of classes with one table per concrete class in the hierarchy.

### Object-Relational Metadata Mapping Patterns

- ***Metadata Mapping***
  Holds details of object-relational mapping in metadata.

- ***Query Object***
  An object that represents a database query.

- ***Repository***
  Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

### Web Presentation Patterns

- ***Model View Controller***
  Splits user interface interaction into three distinct roles.

- ***Page Controller***
  An object that handles a request for a specific page or action on a Web site.

- ***Front Controller***
  A controller that handles all requests for a Web site.

- ***Template View***
  Renders information into HTML by embedding markers in an HTML page.

- ***Transform View***
  A view that processes domain data element by element and transforms it into HTML.

- ***Two Step View***
  Turns domain data into HTML in two steps: first by forming some kind of logical page, then rendering the logical page into HTML.

- ***Application Controller***
  A centralized point for handling screen navigation and the flow of an application.

### Distribution Patterns

- ***Remote Facade***
  Provides a coarse-grained facade on fine-grained objects to improve efficiency over a network.

- ***Data Transfer Object***
  An object that carries data between processes in order to reduce the number of method calls.

### Offline Concurrency Patterns

- ***Optimistic Offline Lock***
  Prevents conflicts between concurrent business transactions by detecting a conflict and rolling back the transaction.

- ***Pessimistic Offline Lock***
  Prevents conflicts between concurrent business transactions by allowing only one business transaction at a time to access data.

- ***Coarse-Grained Lock***
  Locks a set of related objects with a single lock.

- ***Implicit Lock***
  Allows framework or layer supertype code to acquire offline locks.

### Session State Patterns

- ***Client Session State***
  Stores session state on the client.

- ***Server Session State***
  Keeps the session state on a server system in a serialized form

- ***Database Session State***
  Stores session data as committed data in the database.

### Base Patterns

- ***Gateway***
  An object that encapsulates access to an external system or resource.

- ***Service Stub***
  Removes dependence upon problematic services during testing. WSDL

- ***Record Set***
  An in-memory representation of tabular data.

- ***Mapper***
  An object that sets up a communication between two independent objects.

- ***Layer Supertype***
  A type that acts as the supertype for all types in its layer.

- ***Separated Interface***
  Defines an interface in a separate package from its implementation.

- ***Registry***
  A well-known object that other objects can use to find common objects and services.

- ***Value Object***
  A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn't based on identity.

- ***Money***
  Represents a monetary value.

- ***Special Case***
  A subclass that provides special behavior for particular cases.

- ***Plugin***
  Links classes during configuration rather than compilation.

## Development

### How the project was initialized

This project was initialized with the following command:

```shell
## Solution
dotnet new sln -o .

## Examples.Designs.Fowler.Tests
dotnet new xunit3 -o src/Examples.Designs.Fowler.Tests
dotnet sln add src/Examples.Designs.Fowler.Tests/
cd src/Examples.Designs.Fowler.Tests
dotnet add package xunit.v3.mtp-v2
dotnet add package Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage
dotnet add package NSubstitute
cd ../../

# Update outdated package
dotnet list package --outdated
```
