## What is the purpose of this repository?

This repository is just my personal playground for learning programming patterns like Domain-Driven Designs (DDD) with .NET.

The content here might actually be helpful to other developers facing similar issues.

However, please keep in mind that this code is based solely on my own perspective and probably has lots of inaccurate or questionable parts!
